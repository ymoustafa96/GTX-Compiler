Test cases will be graded as follows:
	2 points for correct output
	1-2 points for mostly correct output
	0-1 points for partially correct output
	0 points for no output / can not run

Test1.txt
A simple test case with a .txt extension to test that your
compiler only accepts .gtx files.

Test2.gtx
A simple test case containing only markdown annotations (i.e., 
no variable tags) to test that the compiler works properly for a
simple case.  

Test4.gtx
A simple test case containing invalid markdown annotations to
test that the lexical analyzer recognizes unknown lexemes and
reports them as lexical errors. 

Test5.gtx
A simple test case containing a single, defined variable tag to 
test that the compiler works properly for a variable in a 
simple case. Taken from example in project handout. 


Test7.gtx
A test case to test the scoping of a variable. Taken from the
suggested test cases in the project handout. 

Test8.gtx 
A test case to ensure if there are annotations after \END 
are reported as syntax errors.
